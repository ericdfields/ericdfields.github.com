I've got high hopes for TextMate 2, which we know is happening for sure now. But [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) has been my goto editor for the last few weeks now.

Plenty to like, plenty to [loathe](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4297), but its refreshing and it comes in [Cobalt](http://cloud.ericdfields.com/Dzzz). 

But being blessed with a 27" Cinema Display, one particular feature is providing that "I can never go back to a time before this" feeling I haven't experienced since cold folding: **column view**. Specifically **Columns: 4 ⌥⌘4**.

Right now I'm mostly wearing the hat of Front-End Rails Developer at [HipHost](http://hiphost.com), which means I'm dealing mostly with four types of files: [Controllers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html), [Views](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) stylesheets, and JavaScript.

Now here's that wish: four columns +  four file types + some light OCD = **Assign File Type to Column**.

I should be a good developer and just figure out [how to make this happen](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/python-tutorials/how-to-create-a-sublime-text-2-plugin/). But then there's that free time thing…

If anyone's interested in this, drop me a line. I can at least give a brain dump of my thoughts.
