### I design and build user interfaces for the web.

I am the User Experience (UX) Director at [HipHost](http://hiphost.com), a marketplace for tours and activities led by locals who know their stuff. 

My daily work ranges from **ideating over new features** by sketching, wireframing, and prototyping proofs-of-concept to full-stack development of new features in Ruby on Rails.

I have led the design and development of the front-end user interface for Boston-area start-ups Springpad, I'm in! and College Publisher. I thrive in small-team environments that encourage designer and developer collaboration and transparent communication between business and development.

Previously, I have worked as a consultant on projects for Hanley Wood, Massachusettes Convention Center Authority, Harte Hanks, Bloomingdales, RueLaLa and 38 Studios, and led ambitious redesigns of Audience Rewards and CAPA International Education's home pages.
